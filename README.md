# Health Economics _ SAS    

## Goal
A program that analyzes the datasets by importing data from Access, correcting the large samples stepwise, testing skewness and kurtosis, running correlation, testing by adding interaction terms, etc. 

###  Research Process: 
   - Identify and formulate the problem                 
   - Determine the research design
   - Design the sample and method of data collection 
   - Collect the data 
   - Analyze the data
   - Interpret, discuss, and present the finfdings 
   - Follow-Up   
#### The Workflow of data: 
     - Create structure
     - Enter/Import data
     - Clean data (Missing data/Outliers/data entry error)
     - Describe data
     - Transform data
     - Create a Codebook 
#### Hypothesis Testing:
   -  Formaulate the Hypothesis 
   -  Choose the significant level 
   -  Select an approriate test 
   -  Calculate the test statistic
   -  Make the test decision
   -  Interpret the results  
#### Regression Analysis:
    -  Check the regression analysis data requirements
    -  Specify and estimate the regression model
    -  Test the regression analysis assumptions
    -  Interpret the regression results 
    -  Validate the regression results
    -  Use the regression model
