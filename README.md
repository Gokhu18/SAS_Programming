# SAS _ Correlation and Linear Regression    

A program that analyzes the datasets by importing data from Access, correcting the large samples Stepwise, testing Skewness and Kurtosis, running correlation, testing by Adding Interaction Terms, etc. 

## Background Knowledge
I executed SAS program to do analyses of the Health economics datasets. For better-analyzing data and getting insights out of the datasets, I used SAS to clean the datasets and did both descriptive and predictive analyses including plotting graphs and running correlation.

## Future Interests
I can apply AI algorithm to make analyses the datasets. Therefore, I will use the machine learning to build the best-fit models. 

## Usage

### Perform your Software Deployment

1. If you are modifying an existing SAS deployment, perform a backup before you install your new SAS software order.
- Back up the existing SASHOME directory (for example, C:\Program Files\SASHome).
- Follow your site’s established backup procedures.

2. Follow the supplemental instructions for deploying SAS software.
- If your order contains alternate or supplemental instructions for certain products, these products are listed in product readme files found in your SAS Software Depot.
- The readme files are located in <depot location>/install_doc/<ordernumber>/ReadmeFiles

3. To install your software order, use the SAS Deployment Wizard in your SAS Software Depot.
- Each software order contained in your SAS Software Depot must be installed using the SAS Deployment Wizard, which presents a set of dialogs to help you install and configure your software. The dialogs can vary depending on the contents of the order and your selections in previous dialogs.
- If the order you are installing contains updates or maintenance for software that is currently installed on your system, the SAS Deployment Wizard will present dialogs about applying them to your existing environment.

- Use the method appropriate for the host where the software will be installed:
- Windows users double-click the setup.exe at the root of your SAS Software Depot to start the SAS Deployment Wizard. You may have to right-click the setup.exe and select Run as administrator.
- UNIX users execute setup.sh at the root of the SAS Software Depot.
- Use the dialogs to install and configure your software. For more information about the choices available in each dialog, use the Help button.
- The SAS Deployment Wizard and SAS Deployment Manager 9.4: User’s Guide is available at http://support.sas.com/deploywizug94.html
