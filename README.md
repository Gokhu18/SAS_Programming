# SAS _ Correlation and Linear Regression    

A program that analyzes the datasets by importing data from Access, correcting the large samples stepwise, testing skewness and kurtosis, running correlation, testing by adding interaction terms, etc. 

## Background Knowledge
I executed SAS program to do analyses of the Health economics datasets. For better-analyzing data and getting insights out of the datasets, I used SAS to clean the datasets and did both descriptive and predictive analyses including plotting graphs and running correlation.

## Future Interests
I can apply AI algorithm to make analyses the datasets. Therefore, I can use the machine learning to build the best-fit models for the data-sets. 

## Usage

### Windows users
- In VirtualBox, select the SAS University Edition vApp, and then select Machine > Start. It might take a few minutes for the virtual machine to start.
- In a web browser on your local computer, enter http://localhost:10080.
- From the SAS University Edition: Information Center, click Start SAS Studio.
